//A dream of one’s own copies
A unusual scenario unfolds in front of me: 3, no, at least 6 persons are concurrently living in the same tiny 1-bedroom 1-bathroom studio, and the glorious skyrocketing buildings as framed by the disproportionately huge French window in the living room makes it even more unusual. Still, that falls within all reasons when compared to the fact that all of those men looks completely identical. 
*	[Check if I am turned into one of them too.] Ah…I am ok, as how I look everyday: an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws. 
Good.

{! -> talk1 | -> talk2}

= talk1
+   [Walk toward the window.] -> look1

+	Approaching [one of the copy.] the one who is now sitting on the sofa, I wonders if the way I look will shock him, as it seems like he had lived with people who look exactly like him for a long time.
	**	Have you always been like this? [] My question seems to break some kind of shield around him, but only for a second. He goes on moving his mouth endlessly, talking to someone in the air.
	**	What are you doing? [] “I should say that I can’t take your compliment. As you see, I am just a novice of the field, and I have absolutely no inclination to declare myself as a specia……Thank you, thank you. But…”
		*** Hello? (Who is he talking to? It surely wasn’t me.)	[] His face is still turning toward a hot breath of wind, which is emitted by the huge stalinite mouth.
	-	(talkComplete1)I give up talking to him. -> begin
	

= look1
Toward the window I navigate my unconvenient body around this crowded studio. This city looks appalling especially from such a huge window. Intense exposure to not only sunlight (only reflected from the other glass-covered buildings), but also the dusts rendered visible by the light. 
Let me search for a point of interest. 
-   (lookAtWindow)
+	The street []has the right amount of vehicles a city should have. But no one single human is driving any of them, nor does the sidewalks bear any passengers’ feet. -> lookAtWindow
+	A woman []is busy polishing her make-up at the northeastern direction to the apartment I am in, where the apartment she lives in is standing only one story below this one. 
	**	She looks…[] normal. I don’t really know what counts as beautiful or ugly in human’s standard. She looks very even and symmetrical, and her skin color falls between a creamy brown and beige, if I have to come up with some descriptions. 
	    *** (seeWomanCompleted) [Why?] Why only this woman appears in this dream, and only she looks different than the other moving humans?
	    - I need to find other clues.
	    -> begin
+	The sky []isn’t a sky at all! It is more of a dome of mirror capturing in entire city and its own reflection. -> lookAtWindow


= talk2
*	Approaching [one of the man…copy.] the one who seems to be arguing with another himself, uh, or the other copy. They noticed me when I failed to keep my sturdy feet from colliding with the bar stool at the Kitchen.
	“Hey, you, stranger. You appears at the perfect moment. We are in a small trouble and need some help, will you?“
	
	**	“What do I need to do?” [] I asked. “Well, like he said, we are in a trouble. I think we should buy a mirror in the house, but this mule said it is boring to add a useless furniture only to duplicate yet another of us! How strange is this argument. What do you think, stranger?”
	
	    - (mirror)
	    
	    ***	[Ask them why it is the mirror.] “Well, first of all: why do you want a mirror,” (I look around and confirm that there is no mirror decorated in the house at the moment.) “if you are doing good without one so far?” 
	        -> mirror
    	+++ [Sure. Why not add a mirror.] "What’s so strange about having a mirror? It adds convenience to all of your lives. 
    	    -> talk3
    	+++ (mirrorCorrect) [A mirror is not a good idea for them.] "I agree with the...this gentleman who doesn't like the mirror idea," I continued with their gazes, "You see, the last thing you need is to over-contemplate on yourself anymore. I am talking about you, the host of the house, the dreamer." I look around, and see one of the identical men raises his head, as if just gotten a knock on his head. 
    	    -> talk3
    	
    -> begin
    
= talk3
I waited for their reaction. 

{mirrorCorrect: 
    <> "You...do have a point, my friend." The actual dreamer gives a long look. 

- else:
    <> “Hmmm.” "Hmm." (Are they really considering my advice?) 
    "Can you help with me too?" The voice comes from a man sitting at the corner of the corridor, as if he was avoiding the crowd the whole time.
}
-   "Since you are such an observant figure, why not help me with other problem?"
    *   "I will see what I can do." 
    *   "What a coincidence. I have a tons of questions for you too."
    -   "Listen to this: My friends and colleagues all call me a humble person, but why, why do I hate them so much?"
        **  "You...hate them?" [] "Yes. But thanks to them I have a reputation of being always polite and humble. "
            *** [Is he just a misanthropic type?] "Because you just don't like them anyways?" -> endingFailure
            
            *** [Is there some underlying problems?]
                [{seeWomanCompleted}] <>"Is the woman across the street one of them?" He didn't expect the question, and shakes his head.
                **** [Does he not want that compliment?]"Then how does being called humbled again and again make you feel? You don't identify with that description, do you?" 
                    "What...why do you say that?" 
                    -> finalQuestion
                        
                -   (finalQuestion)
                    "Becasue: you are in fact the opposite of a humble person. Being humble because a social performance.
                    <> {seeWomanCompleted: That woman––you admires the woman who can look straight into her mirror while you don't even dare to put a mirror in your house. }
                    <> {mirrorCorrect: For example, you hate duplication of yourself, because who you really are is a narccistic person, and yet you hate that narccistic aspect of yourself. }
                    Do you see now?"
                    -> endingSuccess
                
    -> DONE
= endingFailure
"You know nothing about me. Get out of here, dream eater. You think I don't know what you are?" His anger grows unexpectantly.
-> END

= endingSuccess
"You might be...you ARE right." His face changes to a softer and yet less confident look. "And you are here to eat this horrible dream, right? Be quick. I want to be awake now and forget all this." 
I hesitates for a moment, "And what would you do tomorrow?"
"I don't know." He signs and seems to make a decision, "But neither should I keep myself here any longer."
-> END
